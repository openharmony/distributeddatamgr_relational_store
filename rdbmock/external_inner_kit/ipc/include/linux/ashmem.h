/**
 * @file linux/ashmem.h
 *
 * @brief Compile-time placeholder for the ashmem ioctl command definitions,
 * co-located with the mock IPC headers. <ashmem.h> from c_utils (included by the
 * mock message_parcel.h) unconditionally includes <linux/ashmem.h>, which is not
 * provided by the host kernel. Any rdbmock target that puts ipc/include on its
 * include path therefore resolves <linux/ashmem.h> to this shim automatically.
 *
 * The mock layer never invokes the ashmem ioctls (WriteAshmem/ReadAshmem are
 * stubbed), so the macro values are never used at runtime; they exist only so
 * the mock compiles. This directory is on the include path solely for non-ohos
 * (host/cross-platform) builds, so device builds keep using the real kernel
 * header.
